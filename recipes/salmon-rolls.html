        <p> As the name suggests, the fillings in this Salmon Avocado Rolls are raw salmon and sliced avocado.They are thick and long, but the Salmon Avocado Roll in this recipe is thinner and cut into bite-size pieces.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>240g/8.5oz sushi rice</li>
        <li>1 sheet yaki nori (roasted seaweed sheet), halved</li>
         <li>100g sashimi salmon strips (2-3 strips of 1cm x 1cm/⅜” x ⅜” wide, 40cm/15¾” long in total)</li>
        <li>4 thin avocado wedges about 10cm/4” long each (note 2)</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a piece of yaki nori on your end of the sushi rolling mat, shiny side of the nori sheet down.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with the vinegar water in the bowl, take ½ of the sushi rice and make an oval ball.</li>
            <li>Place the rice in the centre of the yaki nori sheet and spread the rice in all directions, covering the entire yaki nori, except 1cm/⅜” of the end of the seaweed sheet away from you (this will overlap with the other end when rolled). Ensure that the rice evenly covers the yaki nori sheet, and do not press the rice down too hard.</li>
            <li>Place a strip of salmon in the centre of the rice. If your salmon strips are not as long as the width of the seaweed sheet, connect the short strips so that salmon reaches to both ends.</li>
        </ol>
